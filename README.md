# Mech105-notes_charts
This repository contains lecture notes, charts and drawings from a first year college engineering course. It includes various equations, concepts and tools that can be helpful for solving engineering related problems. I used these notes to help design and create the algorithms found in my Mech 105 Algorithms repository.

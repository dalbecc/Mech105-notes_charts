# Numerical Integration and Differentiation
---
* This folder contains all notes regarding Numerical integratios and it's various methods. These include the trapezoidal rule, the composite trapezoidal rule, simpson's 1/3 rule, composite simpson's 1/3 rule, simpson's 3/8 rule and romberg integration. Numerical differentiation is included as well and containd details on the forward, backwards and centered finite difference approximations as well as the error associated with them. The documents are ordered and labeled by date.
